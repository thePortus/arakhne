I created Arakhne Text Loom so that my students, who have limited programming experience, could load, scrub, analyze, and save a large corpus of texts in a few short lines of code.

The [Natural Language Toolkit](https://nltk.org) has enabled modern text analysis for some years now. Recently, the amazing [Classical Language Toolkit, or CLTK](http://cltk.org), has brought machine language processing to ancient studies. The CLTK library powers the majority of operations behind this module. However, CLTK operations focus on analyzing single bits of text (or other data focused on a single 'document').

As Latinists well know, a *textus* is literally 'something woven.' By unraveling a corpus into a series of documents, words, entities, and the threads that bind them together.
